## Introduction

This build guide will walk you through the tools, materials, and process to build your own
PrintNC. The guide is intended to be complete with all the information you will need for the
full build process, but it is NOT built for easy digestion. Please watch a few video guides
before starting your build for a better overview of the process. When doing your build the
guide can be printed and used as a step-by-step checklist to help ensure no critical steps
are missed or done wrong.

## Important Notes

* Never remove the ball screw nuts from the threaded shaft. The mechanism can be
made irreparable if disassembled incorrectly!
* Several steps in the build process requires using a small allen key to pass through a
small hole to tighten bolts. This limits the types of bolts in several places to button
head style, since those use smaller allen keys. Please make sure you’re using the
correct style of bolts where needed. Ball-nose allen keys with long shafts are
required for these sections.
* Some build steps can be done in alternate order to reduce tool changes or to
accommodate the constraints of optional tools like drill presses. Some known
alternatives include:
	* Combine steps 1 and 4: Y Axis Frame - mark corners and middle, then flip
over and mark BF12. All are M6 Threaded.
