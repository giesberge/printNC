The PrintNC is a high performance, diy cnc router. It's based on a steel frame to ensure rigidity and uses 3d printed parts to make assembly easy.

The PrintNC project is in active development and encourages participation.

**FAQ:** [here](doc/faq.md)

## Where to Start

1. Choose Nema 17 vs Nema 23 stepper motors: [see FAQ](doc/faq.md)
1. Define Size of Footprint and Beams: Calculator ([metric](https://threedesign.store/metric-frame-size-calculator/) / [imperial](https://threedesign.store/imperial-frame-size-calculator/))
1. Get the correct 3D printing files depending on the size and corner radius of your steel beams: [Download](src/) or get the fusion360 file: [Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qccpafKKw5RdyNG6PrTtAz_MatO8Yz8L)
1. Get the right Z-Axis motor mount to print --> depending on the [z-Axis FacePlate](src/FacePlatesDXF) and Motor Version: [Download](src/). 
<br />For more information about cutting your own faceplate, files can be downloaded [here](https://threedesign.store/downloads/). To order a machined plate see the [official store](https://threedesign.store/store/?model_number=faceplate).
1. Collect remaining materials: [see BOM](doc/bom.md)
1. Assemble
